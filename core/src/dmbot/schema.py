"""The database schema, as one ordered list of migrations.

Rules:
- Never edit a migration that has shipped; add a new one.
- Every table holding a Discord server's data has a `guild_id BIGINT NOT NULL` column and
  the `guild_isolation` row-level-security policy (see `_isolate`). Child tables reference
  their parent with `(id, guild_id)`, so a row can't point at another server's data.
- Discord IDs are BIGINT. Timestamps are Unix seconds (BIGINT), matching the app.
