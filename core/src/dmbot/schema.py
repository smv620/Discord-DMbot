"""The database schema, as one ordered list of migrations.

Rules:
- Never edit a migration that has shipped; add a new one.
- Every table holding a Discord server's data has a `guild_id BIGINT NOT NULL` column and
  the `guild_isolation` row-level-security policy (see `_isolate`). Child tables reference
  their parent with `(id, guild_id)`, so a row can't point at another server's data.
- Discord IDs are BIGINT. Timestamps are Unix seconds (BIGINT), matching the app.
- Tables holding a *person's* data (the website's accounts, #435) have a `user_id` and
  the `user_isolation` policy (see `_isolate_user`) instead; list them in
  USER_ISOLATED_TABLES. `installs` is listed there too, though it is keyed by server:
  it's visible to its server and to the person who installed DMbot (see its policies).
- The `dmbot.*` settings that open these doors (server, person, install server, plan
  writer, cleanup) are set by dmbot.db.Database, plus two one-statement switches inside
  a transaction it opened: dmbot.web.me (server by server for /me, then the person) and
  dmbot.entitlements.read (the person, for one read). The database enforces each door's
  limits, but which code may open which door is a Python boundary: only dmbot.web opens
  Database.plan_writer() (tests/test_entitlements_writer.py checks).
- Exception: a *routing* table may skip row-level security if it holds nothing but
  Discord server IDs (no names, settings, or campaign data), because a process has to
  find its servers before it can open a per-server transaction. List it in
  ROUTING_TABLES with a comment saying why.
